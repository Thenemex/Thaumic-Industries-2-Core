# Core mod for my modpack Thaumic Industries 2 - Expert
I added here tweaks that don't really fit well in my other mods, tweaks that are unique to the expert side of the pack.

A config file is also present for turning off/on everything you want or don't want.

### List of tweaks :
  - Replaced the Vanilla Stone Furnace with a mystical construct (some Cobblestone & Coal Block)
  - Replaced the Scribing Tools recipe with an Arcane recipe (Glass Phial, Feather and Ink)
  - Replaced the Thaumometer recipe with an Arcane recipe (only added some vis)
    - The recipe can also be rotated 90Â° sideways (you can flip the gold and shards) 
  - Replaced all research pages associated with those recipes

### Required mods :
This mod requires to have Thaumcraft 4 and NemexLib installed to be able to run.
