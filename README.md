# Core mod for my modpack Thaumic Industries 2 - Expert
I added here tweaks that don't really fit well in my other mods, tweaks that are unique to the expert side of the pack.

A config file is also present for turning off/on everything you want or don't want.

### List of tweaks :
- Expert recipe for Scribing Tools :
  - Removed basic recipes for Scribing Tools (with Phial and Bottle)
  - Removed all pages associated with those recipes
  - Added an Arcane recipe for Scribing Tools (Glass Phial, Feather and Ink)

### Required mods :
This mod requires to have Thaumcraft 4 and NemexLib installed to be able to run.
